## Task 1: Web Scraping and Sentiment Analysis of Customer Reviews
In this task, we will be utilizing web scraping techniques to extract unstructured data, specifically customer reviews, from the British Airways review page on the website [airlinequality.com](https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/british-airways). Once the data has been successfully gathered, we will perform sentiment analysis to categorize the reviews into positive and negative sentiments. This will enable us to gain insights into the overall customer satisfaction and identify common themes among the positive and negative feedback.

The findings from this analysis will be consolidated into a comprehensive PowerPoint presentation, which will visually highlight the key insights, trends, and conclusions derived from the sentiment analysis. This presentation will effectively communicate the customer sentiments and provide actionable insights to stakeholders.

## Task 2: Building a Classification Model for Predicting Customer Buying Behavior
In this task, we will focus on developing a classification model aimed at predicting customer buying behavior. Using historical data, we will analyze various features that influence a customer's decision to make a purchase. The model will be trained and tested to accurately classify and predict whether a customer is likely to make a purchase based on certain behavioral patterns and attributes.

The results of this predictive analysis, along with the performance metrics of the classification model, will be compiled into a detailed PowerPoint presentation. This presentation will illustrate the modeling process, highlight key insights, and showcase the practical applications of the model in predicting customer buying behavior. The goal is to provide a clear understanding of the factors driving customer purchases and how the model can be used to improve business strategies.
